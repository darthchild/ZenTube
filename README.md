# ZenTube - DistractionFree YouTube Client

This project is my personal take on the YouTube experience, designed to help me stay productive without all the distractions. Instead of the usual homepage filled with suggested videos that pull you down the YouTube spiral, this client gives you a clean landing page that shows all your playlists in a simple list view. Itâ€™s just the way I like to use YouTube so I can focus on what I actually want to watch.

## Features
- Landing Page displays all your playlists in a list format.
- Opens playlists directly in the list view, avoiding the automatic play of the first video.

## How to Use It
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:darthchild/ZenTube.git
   cd zentube
   ```

2. Open the ```playlistData.json``` file located in the root directory.

3. Fill in the details of your playlists. Ensure the format matches the required structure.

4. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

5. Run the app:
    ```
    npm start
    ```

## Additional Tips
For enhanced productivity and a better distraction-free experience, you can add [this extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/unhook-remove-youtube-rec/khncfooichmfjbepaaaebmommgaepoid?hl=en-US&utm_source=ext_sidebar) to your browser. It disables recommended videos in the sidebar during video playback and YouTube Shorts altogether.
